import decimal format
LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
private int x1- x coordinate of the first pair
private int x2- x coordinate of the second pair
private int y1-y coordinate of the first pair
private int y2-y coordinate of the second pair
private double yIntercept- assigns the calculated yIntercept of the line to a double
private double slopeY= assigns the calculated first half of the slope
private double slopeX= assigns the calculated second half of the slope
private double slope= assigns the slopeY over slopeX to make one unified slope as a double
private String pairOne= assigns the given numbers as one string coordinate form
private String pairTwo= assigns the second pair of given numbers as one string coordinate form
private Equation= assigns the y=mx+b statement with the already calculated slope and y-intercept

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
sets each parameter as its corresponding attribute with the same name
sets each xy coordinate to one pair that is assigned to attribute pairOne and pairTwo
calculates the slope of the line
calculates the y-intercept of the line
checks if y-intercept is greater then 0.00 to add the plus sign in as a string

Methods
public String distance()
calculates the distance between the two pairs of points and assigns it to a local variable distance
returns distance with dRound.format to round it to hundredths place

public String coordinatePoint(double xValue)
uses the inputted number to find the y value of that number using the already calculated slope and x-y values
returns a string wih the new pair

public String toString()
declares a local string variable called pairs
this will display all relevant information involving the class
including x and y coordinates
y=mx+b formula
y-intercept
slope of line
distance between points

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Greets the user and ask for first coordinate point
Step 2: assigns the given input to a string variable using scanner s
Step 3: use string methods to separate the first pair to convert the string to integers and assign it to x1 and y1
Step 4: asks the user for second coordinate point
Step 5: assigns the given input to another string variable using scanner s
Step 6: repeat step 3 with second pair and assign the converted integers to x2 and y2
step 7: Calls the constructor with a named single object. Parameters are filled with the assigned x1, x2, y1, y2
Step 8: prints the toString method with the declared object name
Step 9: Asks the user for a new x coordinate
Step 10: assigns the given input to a double. The given input is also converted to a double
Step 11: Prints the new coordinate pair using method coordinate point. Method is called with the object name
